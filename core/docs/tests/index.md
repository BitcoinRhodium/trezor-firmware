# Testing

We have two types of tests:

1. Unit tests that are specific to Trezor Core.
2. Common tests, which are common to both Trezor Core (TT) and Legacy (T1). Device tests belong to this category.

## Core tests

See the `core/tests/` directory.

## Common tests

See the [README](../../../tests/README.md) file in `tests/`.
